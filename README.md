# realtime-chat
A real-time chat application with node.js and client-side js. This is a basic chat app using socket.io and node.js. You can use this repo for a fun chatting app.


## How to Setup
### Step 1:
**Before installation, make sure that your system installed node js**

-> First clone this repo `https://github.com/mvish77/realtime-chat.git`

-> Go to the `server` directory (Right-click inside the `server` directory and open the terminal) and run command `npm install`. It installs packages

-> After package install, run the command `node server.js`

-> Your server will run on port 8000 with URL `http://localhost:8000`

-> Now your server is running

-> Now get outside of server directory where other files are located such as `index.html`, `script.js`

### Step 2: 
Open the `index.html` using **Live Server** and have fun ðŸ˜‚. 

Be sure that only you can chat with yourself here. You can chat with yourself by opening multiple browser tabs.

**If you want your friends can connect with this app. Just host it to a cloud Server (Render, Cloudflare, AWS).**

I am using **Render** for hosting.
