# realtime-chat
A realtime chat application with node.js and client side js. You just have to clone this repo and start the server.js script and launch the index.html to connect online

## How to Setup
### Step 1:
**Before instalation, make sure that your system installed node js**

-> First clone this repo `https://github.com/mvish77/realtime-chat.git`

-> after package install, run command `node server.js`

-> your server will run on port 8000 with url `http://localhost:8000`

-> Now your server is running

-> Now get outside of server directory where other files are located such as `index.html`, `script.js`

### Step 2: 
Just open the `index.html` using **Live Server** and have a fun ðŸ˜‚. 

Be sure that only you can chat with yourself here. You can test it by opening in multiple browser tabs.

**If you want that your friends can connect with this app. Just host it to cloud (Render, cloudflare, AWS).**

I am using **Render** for my server side script hosting.
